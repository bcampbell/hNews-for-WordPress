## Adding hNews to an hAtom-supporting theme

hNews builds upon the [hAtom][1] microformat. Luckily, many wordpress
themes already support hAtom, so most of the work is already done for
you.

You'll first need to add an `hnews` class to the post, alongside the
existing `hentry`. In most modern themes, this is handled by
the [post_class][2] template tag, so look through the theme files
for:

    <div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>

and change it to:

    <div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class('hnews'); ?>>

For themes that don't use `post_class()`, you'll instead see something like:

    <div id="post-<?php the_ID();?>"  class="post hentry">

Change it to:

    <div id="post-<?php the_ID();?>"  class="post hentry hnews">



TODO: list likely php files, using twentyten as an example.



You then need to tell your theme to output the hNews-specific fields -
license, principles, dateline (geo) and source organization. This can
be done with a single call to `hnews_meta()`. Just insert this line:

     <?php if (function_exists('hnews_meta')) hnews_meta(); ?>

This should be inside the `hnews` div, and outside the
`entry-content` div (you don't want the hnews data to be
treated as part of the content text).

If you're using an off-the-shelf wordpress theme, it's probably worth
implementing your hNews-supporting version of it as a [child theme] [4].
This will make it easier to track any future updates to the original
theme.
